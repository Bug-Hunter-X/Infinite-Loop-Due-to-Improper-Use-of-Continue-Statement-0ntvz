This repository demonstrates a common but easily overlooked error in Java: creating an infinite loop with the `continue` statement. The `BuggyContinue.java` file shows the erroneous code, where the loop counter is not incremented when the `continue` statement is executed. This results in the loop never terminating for x = 5. The `CorrectedContinue.java` file presents a corrected version.  The difference is subtle, but crucial for avoiding unexpected behavior.  Understanding how control flow statements like `continue` and `break` interact with loop counters is essential for writing robust Java applications.
